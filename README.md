# UU Doomscroller

A serverless, keyless, login-free Android app that plays an endless random portrait
video feed assembled from several public sources.

- **No account, no server, no API key.** Every video is found on the device at the
  moment it is needed, from a randomly chosen subject word.
- **No provider player for YouTube.** A hidden WebView runs `youtubei.js`; the
  app mediates its requests and plays the resulting stream itself, so there are no
  adverts, no subscribe button and no browser chrome.
- **Two controls.** Settings top left, share beneath it. Swipe up for the next
  video, swipe down for the previous, tap to pause.
- **Unfiltered by design.** A first-run notice says so before anything plays.
